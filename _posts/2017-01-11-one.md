Today was our first full day in NYC as proper residents. Taylor and I flew in from RDU last night and made it to our new flat in Harlem after the sun went down. We dropped off our luggage and went out to find a bite. Stumbled into Silvana and enjoyed live music, baba ganouj, and a sidecar. Immediately felt like home.

I ran into [Marlon Craft](https://marloncraft.com/) on the way to the grocery store. I was astonished. I've been listening to his new mixtape for the past month while preparing our move to the city he calls home.

XOXO
