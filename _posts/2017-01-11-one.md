Today was our first full day in NYC as proper residents. Taylor and I flew in from RDU last night and made it to our new flat in Harlem after the sun went down. We threw our luggage down and went out to find dinner. Stumbled into Silvana and enjoyed live music, baba ganouj, and a sidecar. Immediately felt like home.

Something strange and incredible happened today. I met someone on the way to the grocery store. That's not the strange part. The strange part is the fact that I've been listening to this undeniable mixtape from a great rapper, Marlon Craft, lately. And as I've been preparing to move to NYC his music had become the soundtrack to my new found pride in the place I hadn't yet lived and couldn't yet call my own.
