The Grid is an AI website builder platform. Think Squarespace but with robots making smart design decisions based on your content instead of you choosing fonts and colors at random.

When I was hired, the product had advanced engineering components but lacked a cohesive user experience. Our job was to design an interface that would make this powerful technology understandable and easy to use. Leigh Taylor had been single-handedly envisioning and designing the interface - It was both a great pleasure and a mammoth challenge to join this effort.

To our knowledge, no one had ever built an interface for a tool like this before. We were dreaming big, and needed a way to quickly test ideas and avoid dead ends. We employed a process of rapid prototyping, user-testing, and iteration with our engineering team. Eventually arriving at a beta UI as unique as the tool itself.
