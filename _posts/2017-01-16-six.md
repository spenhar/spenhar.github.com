Today today today. First Monday in NYC. I started my week long experiment of writing for an hour everyday. No constraints as to what should come out - a song, prose, or babbling nonsense and self loathing. I did a lot of writing in my new red journal. I wrote about it being the first Monday in NYC and how I seem to be somewhat obsessed with 'firsts' and new things because I can hype them up as times when I will change something about myself and be better and maybe even become the person I think I should/can/want to be.

The question is, why do I want to write in a book and write here on this as well? I'm not sure. I'm not sure there's a point or even a purpose. I've been doubting if writing out every day is actually helpful to me in any way at all. But the experiment I'd like to try is, write everyday. Get practiced. I have a hope it will help me improve my self-understanding and ability to focus on one train of thought, as well as eventually progressing my self-actualization.

In short, setting small goals and sticking to them not sure of the outcome will be good for me.

Good night, Cletus.
