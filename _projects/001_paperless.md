    head: So you want to host an event
    desc: You'll need to design that event page, send out invitations, and you'll need some invite tracking and follow-up tools. We'll try to make this as easy as possible. After all, you've got a party to throw.

    alt:  showing how you can change page styles on your flyer
    head: Easy-bake cake design
    desc: The goal here is to make a design tool that has a lot of customization power but very little cognitive load on the customer. One of my favorite challenges.

    head: Content collections
    desc: By creating groups of related content, customer can pick an image that is closely related to the example they picked. You know like maybe a pumpkin instead of a ghoul.

    head: Flyer phone friendly
    desc: Always designing for the mobile experience first, has held us accountable for a future where we can reach people where they are - on their phone and not their email inbox.

    desc: Proof that I can draw boxes with legible handwriting. But in all seriousness, many times we returned to the drawing board to check that we understood the customer needs. From creating your event page, finding and setting the correct RSVP button options, inviting guests, managing guests, oh yeah, and hosting a party. Hopefully we made it easier and more fun.

I joined in early 2017 to envision a new product within an established, and revered, online events company. Paperless Post practically invented the e-card and definitely perfected the digital-gold-foiled, high-touch aesthetic that party hosts love and trust for the biggest moments of their lives. But we wanted to support the album release parties just as well as those once-a-decade milesones.

[Flyer by Paperless Post](https://paperlesspost.com/flyer/) was born.

Since launch, I have continued to evolve the invitation creation flow and the host management toolset. Most recently, I was responsible for the design and implementation of our checkout for premium paid features in Flyer.

I was on a lean team tasked to design and deliver an MVP for Flyer. We audited. We researched. We hypothtesized. In order to grow our audience, Flyer needed greater range of design expression, a faster create experience, modern distribution methods (who uses emails for a last minute brunch with your bffs anyways?), and an accessible pricing model.

We successfully launched the spartan yet functional *Flyer* in about 6 months. Benefitting greatly from our existing user base, we were able to test and improve almost immediately with real world activity. Boy, we had a lot of work to do. But it worked, humans were using it, and they seemed to be happily hosting events in categories we had never seen before with our classic cards product.

Since launch, I have continued to evolve the invitation creation flow and the host management toolset. Most recently, I was responsible for the design and implementation of our checkout for premium paid features in Flyer.

In addition to the work within my feature team, the product design team and I create and maintain the visual language and React components that power Paperless Posts's online invitation products, helping about a million hosts throw parties yearly.
