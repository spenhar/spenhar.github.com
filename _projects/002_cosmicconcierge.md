    alt:  areas of the work i was involved in
    head: So you want to host an event
    desc: You'll need to design that event page, send out invitations, and you'll need some invite tracking and follow-up tools. We'll try to make this as easy as possible. After all, you've got a party to throw.

    alt:  showing how you can change page styles on your flyer

    alt:  hand drawn sketches of a user flow
    head: Flows on a whiteboard
    desc: Proof that I can draw boxes with legible handwriting. But in all seriousness, many times we returned to the drawing board to check that we understood the customer needs. From creating your event page, finding and setting the correct RSVP button options, inviting guests, managing guests, oh yeah, and hosting a party. Hopefully we made it easier and more fun.

When Stanton Jones calls, you pick up the phone. "Hello I've got this crazy idea to put a mirror on a giant spinning seat so it's like an infinity mirror galaxy in which you spin and reach a weightless euphoria. and there is are real chimes installed on the underside of the floating spinning seat that tell your fortune.
