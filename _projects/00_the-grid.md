    desc: Directing users to download the mobile app. We needed a way to quickly test ideas and avoid dead ends. We employed a process of rapid prototyping, user-testing, and iteration with our engineering team. Eventually arriving at a beta UI as unique as the tool itself.

This is not another do-it-yourself website builder. The Grid harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to take everything you throw at it - videos, images, text, urls, and more - and automatically shape them into a custom website unique to you. Think Squarespace but with robots making smart design decisions for you and churning out a custom website as unique as your content. The promise was huge. I'll drink that Kool-Aid.

When I was hired, the product had advanced engineering components but lacked a cohesive user experience. Our job was to design an interface that would make this powerful technology understandable and easy to use. Leigh Taylor had been single-handedly envisioning and designing the interface - It was both a great pleasure and a mammoth challenge to join this effort.

To our knowledge, no one had ever built an interface for a tool like this before. We were dreaming big, and needed a way to quickly test ideas and avoid dead ends. We employed a process of rapid prototyping, user-testing, and iteration with our engineering team. Eventually arriving at a beta UI as unique as the tool itself.
