    alt:  areas of the work i was involved in
    head: So you want to host an event
    desc: You'll need to design that event page, send out invitations, and you'll need some invite tracking and follow-up tools. We'll try to make this as easy as possible. After all, you've got a party to throw.

    head: Easy-bake cake design
    desc: The goal here is to make a design tool that has a lot of customization power but very little cognitive load on the customer. One of my favorite challenges.

    head: Content collections
    desc: By creating groups of related content, customer can pick an image that is closely related to the example they picked. You know like maybe a pumpkin instead of a ghoul.

    head: Flyer phone friendly
    desc: Always designing for the mobile experience first, has held us accountable for a future where we can reach people where they are - on their phone and not their email inbox.

    head: Flows on a whiteboard
    desc: Proof that I can draw boxes with legible handwriting. But in all seriousness, many times we returned to the drawing board to check that we understood the customer needs. From creating your event page, finding and setting the correct RSVP button options, inviting guests, managing guests, oh yeah, and hosting a party. Hopefully we made it easier and more fun.

Unless you live in a remote cabin surrounded by a Faraday cage, you probably have a Paperless Post invite in your inbox somewhere.

The online cards giant had a vision to expand their reach to more event types and a younger audience. Enter Flyer - a playful and more approachable events platform for all events not just milestones birthdays and weddings.

I was brought on in 2017 to take this idea from concept to build. We basically built a start-up product within an established org. Fun challenge.
