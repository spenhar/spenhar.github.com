    head: So you want to host an event
    desc: You'll need to design that event page, send out invitations, and you'll need some invite tracking and follow-up tools. We'll try to make this as easy as possible. After all, you've got a party to throw.

I'm currently a Product Designer for Paperless Post where I am joyously building products that help people gather together in real life.

I joined the team in early 2017 to envision a new product within an established, and revered, online events company. Paperless Post practically invented the e-card and definitely perfected the digital-gold-foiled, high-touch aesthetic that party hosts love and trust for the biggest moments of their lives: weddings, graduations, 50th anniversaries, etc. But we needed to capture more events than just the once-a-decade milesones.

[Flyer by Paperless Post](https://paperlesspost.com/flyer/) was born.

Since launch, I have continued to evolve the invitation creation flow and the host management toolset. Most recently, I was responsible for the design and implementation of our checkout for premium paid features in Flyer.

I was on a lean team tasked to design and deliver an MVP for Flyer. We audited. We researched. We hypothtesized. In order to grow our audience, Flyer needed greater range of design expression, a faster create experience, modern distribution methods (who uses emails for a last minute brunch with your bffs anyways?), and an accessible pricing model.

We successfully launched the spartan yet functional *Flyer* in about 6 months. Benefitting greatly from our existing user base, we were able to test and improve almost immediately with real world activity. Boy, we had a lot of work to do. But it worked, humans were using it, and they seemed to be happily hosting events in categories we had never seen before with our classic cards product.

Since launch, I have continued to evolve the invitation creation flow and the host management toolset. Most recently, I was responsible for the design and implementation of our checkout for premium paid features in Flyer.

In addition to the work within my feature team, the product design team and I create and maintain the visual language and React components that power Paperless Posts's online invitation products, helping about a million hosts throw parties yearly.
