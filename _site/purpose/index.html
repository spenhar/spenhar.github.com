    <h1 id="purpose">Purpose</h1>

<p>We’re setting out to build the creative studio (practice) we wish existed.</p>

<p>(Say what we DO, not what we want to do? “We build brands for Visionaries” // “We <strong>__ for __</strong>”)</p>

<p>Studio vs. Agency
There is a strong differentiation to the fact we say ‘Studio’ instead of ‘Agency’
A studio is approachable.
An Agency has process and tradition.
A studio decides to oil paint on wednesday afternoon in the office.
An Agency has strictly kept work hours.</p>

<p>Purpose
We’re building the creative practice we wish existed.</p>

<p>For our clients: we build trust with your users, customers and communities.
For ourselves: we believe that autonomy and community are the most important factors in a creative life.</p>

<p>We believe that value lies beyond profit,</p>

<p>In every project, we seek to provide sustainability, social benefit, and profit to our clients bottom line.</p>

<p>For us to accept a project, it must meet the following criteria:
Social Good
Environmental Improvement</p>

<p>We seek open, honest relationships with our clients and we encourage them to do the same with their customers.</p>

<p>We help companies, organizations, and people build trust with their users, customers, and communities.
We want to feel as confident in our clients as they do in us. For that reason, we take care to make sure our goals and stories align.</p>

<p>We believe that autonomy and community are the most important factors in a creative career. Without control of your work and trust from your teammates, you lose heart and reason for working.
Nothing kills our creativity like hierarchy, micromanagement, and 8 hours at the same desk every day.</p>

<p>We take pride in our agility,</p>

<p>Who We Work With:
Dreamers, Go Getters, Social Workers.</p>

<p>What We Do:
Brand Strategy &amp; Consulting
Media Installations &amp; Technical Work</p>

<p>Our process
Iterative, Agile.
We aren’t decorators and we don’t shine lemons.</p>

<p>Through research, strategy, design, and manufacturing.
We believe that creative goals should align with business goals,</p>

<h2 id="principles-of-practice">Principles of Practice:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Design Theory
    <ul>
      <li>The best design starts early, digs deep, and doesn’t stop as time goes on. (…)</li>
      <li>There are problems everywhere that need solving. You hire a designer to do the struggling for you. We take joy in the hunt for elegant solutions. And Alex has really great hair.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Polishing Turds //feels similar to 3. – Is it important to say this at all?
    <ul>
      <li>No one likes polishing a turd. For that reason, we are not looking to sell products that we don’t believe in</li>
      <li>We will not sell empty promises. If theres a product or idea we don’t believe in, we won’t accept the job. If we think the idea is great but the business isn’t quite there, we want to be involved in the strategy of making the product better before we try to convince people to like it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Partnerships
    <ul>
      <li>We want to feel as confident in our clients as they do in us. For that reason, we will be careful to make sure we feel our goals and stories align. We do our best work when we are in the company of the right people who have the right chemistry. And that doesn’t mean the same opinion or perspective in the world. But the hot air must always propel us in an upward spiral.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>(“We make considered, relevant and long-lasting brands for visionaries of all varieties” -omfgco)</p>

<p>** SHOW DONT TELL
I don’t want to say we do all this shit. I want to say it in an interesting way.
Like some kind of short story, or a simple example/parable.</p>

<h3 id="for-ourselves">For Ourselves</h3>

<h3 id="for-our-clients">For Our Clients</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Function and Form
both need to be successful in order to capture attention, great food without a sign means slow growth, but beautiful menus with disappointing food will kill a customer base. We understand that you need both to succeed.
Our creative goals are always directly aligned with business goals.
We’ll say it plain and simple. We’re not in the business of polishing turds.
We work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everything All The Time
Nothing builds business strength like brand consistency in every touchpoint.
For Our Employees / Other Coworkers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that autonomy and community are the most important factors in a creative career.
Without control of your work and trust from your teammates, you become a cog, and you lose heart and reason for working. Nothing kills our creativity like hierarchy, micromanagement, and 8 hours at the same desk.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So how do function as a company??
We have regular check-ins at fixed times &amp; places, but keep minimal office hours so no one burns out.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Critique &amp; Iteration
There are a lot of words for this process, but we think that the creative classroom model is among the most effective ways for moving projects forward. The desire to keep up with your peers and impress ones mentors is a powerful motivator in self initiated work.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’re glad you made it this far.</p>

<p>If you like the sound of things, please give us a shout.

<h1 id="purpose-1">Purpose</h1>

<h1 id="intention">Intention</h1>

<p>To build a practice that we wish existed–</p>

<p>A practice that gives it’s partners autonomy and community, rather than micromanagement and unreal expectations</p>

<p>One that applies design thinking to transcend mediums and improve a business at it’s core, rather than falsely advertise</p>

<p>One with regulated scale, to maintain standards of quality for work and health of working relationships</p>

<p>One that selects clients carefully, based on mutual interest and shared story</p>

<h1 id="statement-of-benefit">Statement of benefit</h1>

<p>What will clients get from us that makes us different?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Youthful, optimistic energy with seasoned pragmatism.</li>
  <li>Holistic vision followed by execution with rational methods &amp; realistic budgets.</li>
  <li>We aren’t a one-trick pony.</li>
  <li>We tell it like it is.</li>
  <li>You get analysis, strategy, and insight. We don’t just want to know your business goals, we find out what your people’s goals are.</li>
  <li>We refer to users, customers, and consumers as people. This helps us learn more about them.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="our-principles-of-design">Our Principles of Design</h1>

<p>We strive to make work that works first and looks great second.</p>

<p>We look outside of the common uses of design and technology</p>

<p>Who?</p>

<p>Where?</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>Wut?</p>

<p>We believe in basic interconnectedness of everything, and joint responsibility to all humanity.
We happen to be talented at design.</p>

<p>We believe in service to humankind.  / humanity, and responsibility to our planet.
Our paths led to design because of our desire to make creativity accessible.</p>

<p>We believe that our work can be greater than the sum of our parts.</p>

<p>We think creatively and connect people with different skills to accomplish work that is greater than the sum of our parts.
We are orchestrators of accessibility, aesthetics,</p>

<p>Our work is pragmatic, accessible, and whenever possible, whimsical/delightful.</p>

<p>Like most businesses, design tends to serve the already well-served, and flock toward the crowded markets.</p>

<p>We see great opportunity in looking to the rest of the globe, looking to the future, looking beyond the hottest app or latest way to complain.</p>

<p>We look outside our areas of expertise</p>

<p>We strive to make work that transcends geography and time.
We believe function and beauty are symbiotic.</p>

<p>To put it simply,
We make carefully considered, creative work that works–for as many people as possible.</p>

<p>we make work that works.</p>

<p>because we make work that stands the test of time.
we look to the future
we research the past, consider the future, and make work for the present.
because the right answer to a problem isn’t always what’s trending.
and doesn’t just look pretty. pragmatism, usefulness, timelessness, functionality,</p>

<p>Wut?</p>

<p>Strategic, because we make work that works—-today and tomorrow.
Interdisciplinary, because the right solution isn’t always an integrated social media virus.
Everybody, because we believe in the democratization of design.</p>

<p>MORF is led by Spencer Harrison and Alex Bloom.</p>

<p>of as many people as possible
 around the globe</p>

<p>because we believe strive to make work that transcends geographic &amp; cultural &amp; economic borders, to serve as many people as possible. because the right answer to a problem isn’t always what’s trending. (so hot right now)</p>

<p>Design - because</p>

<p>we believe in inclusivity, that creativity shouldn’t require, great</p>

<p>We want our work to work-—for as many people as possible, and for as many years as possible.
And is beautiful, attractive, timeless, craftsmanship, and is accessible for all.</p>

<p>We believe function and beauty are symbiotic. We look over the engine and we put on a new coat of paint.
We believe in clarity of message over
We believe in simplicity over trends
Thorough research
Consider every project pragmatically, theoretically, and aesthetically.
Define our aesthetics by research, breadth of translation.
Pragmatic approaches, with entertaining flare.
We believe that design as product should be accessible to everyone</p>

<p>What led me to design was my desire to make my work accessible to everyone.</p>

<p>Analysis of true problems rather than band-aids.</p>

<p>We focus on accessibility of information, product, and communication. We take into consideration people of all abilities in every aspect of the work we make. (Probably the most unique angle we can take)</p>

<p>Accessibility, affordability, and sustainability.</p>

<p>We believe the focus of our energy should solve problems for the.
We believe in the democratization of technology, rather than profiteering.</p>

<p>We believe in open sourcing.
We believe in design as service to one’s community.</p>

<p>” I want to weild design like a sword of justice “
  – paraphrased from James Victore</p>

<p>” Your logo is bullshit. Your studio is bullshit. Your  “</p>

<p>We are democratizing design.</p>
