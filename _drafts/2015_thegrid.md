Think Squarespace but with AI robots making smart design decisions for you and churning out a custom website as unique as your content. The promise was huge. Building it was even bigger. I was designing interfaces to simplify advanced engineering layout systems in a way that was stupid simple to use. Working on web-design intelligence lit my passion for creation tools.

My first proper role as a product designer was working under [Nick Jones](https://www.narrowdesign.com/) and [Leigh Taylor](https://www.behance.net/thisislat) at The Grid, a successfully crowdfunded startup based in SF.
