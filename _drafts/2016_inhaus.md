Before Paperless Post, I was running a little design operation called Morf Studio in Carrboro, NC with my good pal [Alex Bloom](https://alexbloom.co/). We did contract product design work and made websites for a local bagel place, an [anti-establishment bike shop](http://backalleybikes.net/), a [cross-country cycling and home-building non-profit](https://bikeandbuild.org/2015annualreport/index.html), and a [clothing retailer in LA](https://shop-midland.com/).
