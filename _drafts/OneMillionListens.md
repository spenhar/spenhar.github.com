I've never had a million of anythings.
Except electrons in my body, and atomic particles.

I've enjoyed a solid amount of self loathing over the fact that I've referred to myself as a musician, as a songwriter, and as a producer, as a designer, as a front end developer, but when I find that I haven't been producing and releasing work into the wild - I make all these things void.

How can I be a producer if I don't produce?
How can I be a songwriter when I haven't written a song in months?

`I've never had a million of anything and I'm setting a goal to have a million listens to my music.`

Let's do some math:
120,000 listens for Mideau on [Spotify][spotify-mideau].
2,565 listens for spenhar on [Soundcloud][soundcloud].
