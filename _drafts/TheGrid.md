## How I helped robots build your website.

The Grid Promise:

"This is not another do-it-yourself website builder. The Grid harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to take everything you throw at it - videos, images, text, urls and more - and automatically shape them into a custom website unique to you. As your needs grow, it evolves with you, effortlessly adapting to your needs. Want to add e-commerce? Social feeds? A different layout? The Grid just takes care of it. This is not a website builder. This is your personal AI web developer. Its first masterpiece is the website you're looking at right now. Its next one could be yours."

That's a big promise.

My Role & What I learned



### What was The Grid
Moving from being a new designer in a prototyping shop to being a designer at a start-up with a product was a big step for us.

New job, new jargon.
If CSS preprocessors were complicated 3 months ago, then I'm thrown into the world of Cassowary Constraint Solvers.

### What Problem were we Solving?
- All the best designers ask this question, so I'm just copying them.
- The Website Problem
  - The world is a big place. There are a lot of people in the world. Everyday means more and more people on the internet who want to socialize, do business, and communicate in the form of a website. Web Developers know how to make a website. Squarespace/Weebly/Wix found ways to make it possible for more people to make their own website. Afterall, any front-end developer knows there are many tasks when building a website that are highly repetitive. Why not build a web application where I can enter my site name, navigation items, and a few photographs into some form fields and have a site generate? Genius! Sign me up. But what happens when you give the average person control over color selection for 20+ elements on a web page? A rainbow explosion. And not the kind where candy comes out. Whytho? The average person (read: not designer) doesn't dream about complimentary color palettes or how poorly contrasted text becomes straining and unreadable on the web. They also don't think about how a full-width photo section right on top of a full width photo section becomes busy and unfortunately difficult to read the overlaid eggplant purple text. Look, I believe everyone is an artist. Some people spend time thinking about colors, most people don't. Wouldn't it be great if there were a solution that did all that default it's-gonna-look-good thinking for you? I think so, because I'm into the world being a more beautiful place. If you want to design your own site, do it! If you want it to look like a seasoned designer designed your site but don't have the cash to pay a seasoned designer, use The Grid! That was why we wanted to do it. Even Squarespace and Wix have you select a template, and then swap out the default text/images with your own. That is one way to do it - but honestly, I was sold on the vision of The Grid. Instead of using some default template, throw your content at the AI solvers, it will be assessed, it will be laid own on a web page optimising for every details images
  - The AI would solve problems (like where the face was in a photo so as not to overlay some regions with text) Leigh and I were tasked with designing the chrome for web, mobile, and native applications.


### What I did for the grid
- UI Design
  - Leigh Taylor
    - The reason I was there.
    - My mentor
      - Challenged me to think oblique. Big Futuristic Visionary and Tiny Detail specific. Leigh seriously designs with every single pixel in mind. Every time he spaced a paragraph from a heading, he would measure with meticulous care. Shift+Cmd+down*5+up+up. The Grid, in a way, offered Leigh (and later me) a smooth and blank world to terraform with his design ideals. Systems. Grids. Type Scales. Sacred Numbers and Ancient Geometry found their place in the world of AI because of Leigh's dreaming.
- User Experience
  - Late to the game
    - From what I can tell, every start-up is in some stage of coming-of-age (If not they wouldn't be called a "start-up" but some kind of "middle-up" or "end-up" which sounds bad for business).

### What's Going on with The Grid?
This is the most common question I get with regards to The Grid.
