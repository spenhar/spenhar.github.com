I"b<p>Morf Studio: The concept, the beginning. Alex and I had met when I was working for The Experiment. He was brought in on a project we were working on that ended up winning a bajillion awards. So we decided to rent a mini shed, hustle some of our own clients, And get to it.
We found we had so much in common regarding design, product, digital etc.</p>
