I"å<p>My first proper role as a product designer was working under <a href="https://www.narrowdesign.com/">Nick Jones</a> and <a href="https://www.behance.net/thisislat">Leigh Taylor</a> at The Grid, a successfully crowdfunded startup based in SF.</p>

<p>Think Squarespace but with AI robots making smart design decisions for you and churning out a custom website as unique as your content. The promise was huge. The task of building it was even bigger.</p>

<p>When I was hired, the product had advanced engineering components but lacked a cohesive user experience. My job was to design an interface that would make this powerful technology understandable and easy to use. Working on web-design robots lit my passion for creation tools.</p>
