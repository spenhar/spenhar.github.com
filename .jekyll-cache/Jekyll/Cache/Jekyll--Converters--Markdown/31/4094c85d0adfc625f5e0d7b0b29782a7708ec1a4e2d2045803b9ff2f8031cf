I"F<p>Today was our first full day in NYC as proper residents. Taylor and I flew in from RDU last night and made it to our new flat in Harlem after the sun went down. We dropped off our luggage and went out to find a bite. Stumbled into Silvana and enjoyed live music, baba ganouj, and a sidecar. Immediately felt like home.</p>
