I"ô<p>Before Paperless Post, I was running a little design operation called Morf Studio in Carrboro, NC with my good pal <a href="https://alexbloom.co/">Alex Bloom</a>. We designed and coded websites for a local bagel place, an <a href="http://backalleybikes.net/">anti-establishment bike shop</a>, a <a href="https://bikeandbuild.org/2015annualreport/index.html">cross-country cycling and home-building non-profit</a>, and a <a href="https://shop-midland.com/">clothing retailer in LA</a>. In addition, we took Product Design contracts that mostly made us realize how difficult it is to do meaningful and lasting work in this type of short-term and disconnected agency model. To that end, we both determined to find full-time roles within product orgs.</p>
