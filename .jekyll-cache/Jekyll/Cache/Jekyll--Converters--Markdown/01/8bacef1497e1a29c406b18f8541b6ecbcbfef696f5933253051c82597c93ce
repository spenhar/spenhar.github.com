I"“<h5 id="what">WHAT</h5>
<p>In an effort to calm and collect ourselves for the road ahead, Taylor suggested we host a concert this Sunday evening because she ‚Äúthought people could use some soothing Spen voice.‚Äù So, we‚Äôre doing that. I‚Äôm going to prepare some songs to sing - some of my favorites, some that I‚Äôve written, some that I‚Äôm writing this week, perhaps some that we can all sing along to.</p>

<h5 id="when">WHEN</h5>
<p>Sunday Nov 13, 2016 ‚Ä¢ 7PM</p>

<h5 id="where">WHERE</h5>
<p>At the <a id="red-link" target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/PwbWEdaaQzt">little cottage</a> in Carrboro. 
Our place is 503C Oak Ave, which is the little grey cottage with a red door to the right and behind 503 Oak Ave (the house on the linked map). Parking is a bit confusing if you‚Äôve never been before but we‚Äôll help direct. Carpool or unicycle if possible.</p>

<h5 id="refreshments">REFRESHMENTS</h5>
<p>We‚Äôll provide various flavors of popped corn and seasonal cider. Required: bring your heart and that face we love so much. Optional: bring drinks and/or something snacky to share and/or firewood for the firepit.</p>

<p>XOXO</p>

<p>Spencer &amp; Taylor</p>
