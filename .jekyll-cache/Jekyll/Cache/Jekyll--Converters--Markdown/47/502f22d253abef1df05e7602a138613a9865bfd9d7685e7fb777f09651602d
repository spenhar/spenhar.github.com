I"¼<p>Iâ€™m currently a Product Designer for Paperless Post where I am joyously building products that help people gather together in real life.</p>

<p>I joined the team in early 2017 to envision a new product within an established, and revered, online events company. Paperless Post practically invented the e-card and definitely perfected the digital-gold-foiled, high-touch aesthetic that party hosts love and trust for the biggest moments of their lives: weddings, graduations, 50th anniversaries, etc.</p>

<p>The problem - we were only serving the once-a-decade milestones and not the fortnightly happy hours. In order to grow,</p>

<p><a href="https://paperlesspost.com/flyer/">Flyer by Paperless Post</a> was born.</p>

<p>Since launch, I have continued to evolve the invitation creation flow and the host management toolset. Most recently, I was responsible for the design and implementation of our checkout for premium paid features in Flyer.</p>
