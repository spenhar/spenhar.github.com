I"\<p>Today was our first full day in NYC as proper residents. Taylor and I flew in from RDU last night and made it to our new flat in Harlem after the sun went down. We dropped off our luggage and went out to find a bite. Stumbled into Silvana and enjoyed live music, baba ganouj, and a sidecar. Immediately felt like home.</p>

<p>I ran into <a href="https://marloncraft.com/">Marlon Craft</a> on the way to the grocery store. I was astonished. Iâ€™ve been listening to his new mixtape for the past month while preparing our move to the city he calls home.</p>

<p>XOXO</p>
