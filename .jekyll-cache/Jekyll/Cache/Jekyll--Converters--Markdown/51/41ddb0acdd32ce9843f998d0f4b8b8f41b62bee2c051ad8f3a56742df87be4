I"<p>Today today today. First Monday in NYC. I started my week long experiment of writing for an hour everyday. No constraints as to what should come out - a song, prose, or babbling nonsense and self loathing. I did a lot of writing in my new red journal. I wrote about it being the first Monday in NYC and how I seem to be somewhat obsessed with ‘firsts’ and new things because I can hype them up as times when I will change something about myself and be better and maybe even become the person I think I should/can/want to be.</p>
