        <!-- <h1 class=""> About </h1> -->
        <h2>Hey, I'm Spencer</h2>
        <p>
          Born in Salt Lake City to an orchestra of siblings - my first language was music and improvising ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Up until 2013 I was performing and running a music studio full time. I loved it, but felt an incompleteness in my creativity as a result of neglecting visual design.
          I decided to apply to architecture schools and learn to code.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2014 I moved to North Carolina and picked up an internship at McKinney which led to a job for a small design/dev shop called 'The Experiment' (aptly named to mark the official beginning of my design career) which led to a job for a start-up out of SF called 'The Grid'.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is an important looking graph:

          In 2014 I moved to North Carolina and sought out an internship at McKinney where I realized there are a bunch of brilliantly creative people that get paid to brainstorm and make things.
          I could definitely get into this.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of the summer, I was hired by one of the Art Directors for a new start-up he was starting-up called 'The Experiment' - An aptly named company to mark the official beginning of my design career.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working with The Experiment I sharpened my skills in UI design and got a huge education in web development. Good habits and bad habits we're learned, but the exposure alone was enough to start the fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a year with The Experiment I began working for a Silicon Valley start-up called 'The Grid' doing UI design and user testing.

        <h2> What I've worked on </h2>
        <p>
          Because I've worked for small teams, I've had the opportunity to be involved in many facets of business and process.
        </p>
        <p>
          New business, Research, wire-framing, user-testing, user interface design, and even front-end development when all the smart engineers are home sick.
